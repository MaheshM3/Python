Ease of Use: Databricks provides a managed platform with a user-friendly interface, simplifying Spark job setup compared to manual configuration on AKS.
Scalability: Automatically handles cluster scaling and resource management, unlike AKS, which requires manual tuning.
Performance: Optimized Spark engine with features like Delta Lake and Adaptive Query Execution for faster processing.
Integration: Seamless integration with data lakes, cloud storage, and BI tools, reducing setup complexity on AKS.
Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go pricing with auto-scaling minimizes waste; AKS requires manual cost management.
Maintenance: Fully managed infrastructure reduces DevOps overhead compared to managing Kubernetes clusters on AKS.
Collaboration: Built-in notebooks and workspace enhance team collaboration, absent in raw AKS setups.
Security: Enterprise-grade security features like role-based access control, easier to implement than on AKS.
