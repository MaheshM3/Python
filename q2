Q2 Project Deliverables and Impact

As part of Q2 project deliveries, I contributed significantly to the following key initiatives that were critical to achieving our OKRs:

Refactoring of Rule Engine
Improved maintainability, performance, and scalability of the engine by addressing core inefficiencies.

Developed Azure utility for authentication and blob storage access, enabling secure and seamless integration with cloud resources.

Overhauled dependency management, removing reliance on Nexus, which streamlined builds and reduced external dependency risks.

Refactored the rule execution logic, optimized SQL generation, and removed duplicate code, leading to better performance and easier debugging.


Job Cluster Migration from APC
Migrated workloads to job clusters for better resource efficiency and cost optimization.
This enabled dynamic scaling, isolated job runs, and improved CI/CD alignment.

Profiling Dashboard Issue Fixes
Resolved critical bugs affecting data accuracy and user experience.
Improved dashboard reliability and trust in reported profiling metrics for stakeholders.

Rule Item Deployment on Job Cluster
Enabled isolated and repeatable rule deployments, reducing the risk of system-wide issues.
This increased deployment confidence and reduced turnaround times.

Alongside these, I supported the team with release activities and knowledge sharing to ensure smooth deployment processes and team enablement.
